### üåê HOSTING 
My website is hosted on GitHub Pages, a service provided by GitHub for hosting static sites directly from a repository.<br>

GitHub Pages offers a straightforward and efficient way to publish content on the web. <br>

<u>Here's how it works:</u>

#### Repository Setup:<br>
The website's source code is stored in a GitHub repository.<br>
By pushing changes to the repository, the site automatically updates.<br>

#### Free SSL:<br>
GitHub Pages offers free SSL certificates, ensuring that our site is served over HTTPS for secure communication.<br>

- GitHub Pages is an ideal hosting solution for static websites due to its ease of use, integration with version control,
- and zero-cost hosting.
